## FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE

### Navigation.
* Page links are centrally positioned in the header, subtly offset to the right for a visually appealing and user-friendly navigation experience.
* The page links feature a responsive design with a 'hover' animation, lighting up in a vibrant blue color when users hover over them. Once clicked, a distinct 'active' animation is applied, ensuring clarity by displaying a persistent blue border bottom to indicate the current page and enhance user navigation.
